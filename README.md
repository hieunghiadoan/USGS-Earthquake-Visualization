# USGS Earthquake Visualization

An interactive web-based map to visualize earthquake data collected by the United States Geological Survey (USGS), highlighting the relationship between tectonic plates and seismic activity.

## Background

The USGS is responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment, and the impacts of climate and land-use change. They collect a vast amount of earthquake data from around the world daily. This project aims to develop a visualization tool for USGS data, allowing them to better educate the public and other government organizations on issues facing our planet.

## Features

- Leaflet-based interactive map
- Visualization of earthquake data based on longitude and latitude
- Data markers reflecting earthquake magnitude (size) and depth (color)
- Popups with additional information about each earthquake
- Map legend providing context for the data
- Visualization of tectonic plates dataset
- Multiple base maps and overlays
- Layer controls for independent toggling of datasets

## Data Sources

- Earthquake data: [USGS GeoJSON Feed](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php)
- Tectonic plates data (optional): [Tectonic Plates dataset on GitHub](https://github.com/fraxen/tectonicplates)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

## Usage

Explore the interactive map to see the earthquake data visualized with markers representing magnitude and depth. Click on individual markers to get more information about each earthquake.
