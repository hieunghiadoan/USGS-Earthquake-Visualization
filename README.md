# USGS Earthquake Visualization

A web-based map that is interactive in nature has been developed to display the earthquake data gathered by the United States Geological Survey (USGS). This map aims to emphasize the correlation between tectonic plates and seismic events.

## Background

The USGS has the responsibility of supplying scientific information regarding natural disasters, the well-being of our ecosystems and surroundings, and the consequences of climate change and alterations in land usage. On a daily basis, they gather a substantial quantity of earthquake-related data from various locations globally. The objective of this initiative is to create a visualization tool specifically for USGS data, enabling them to enhance public awareness and provide educational resources to other government entities regarding the challenges our planet is confronting.
## Features

- Leaflet-based interactive map
- Visualization of earthquake data based on longitude and latitude
- Data markers reflecting earthquake magnitude (size) and depth (color)
- Popups with additional information about each earthquake
- Map legend providing context for the data
- Visualization of tectonic plates dataset
- Multiple base maps and overlays
- Layer controls for independent toggling of datasets

## Data Sources

- Earthquake data: [USGS GeoJSON Feed](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php)
- Tectonic plates data (optional): [Tectonic Plates dataset on GitHub](https://github.com/fraxen/tectonicplates)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

## Usage

Explore the interactive map to see the earthquake data visualized with markers representing magnitude and depth. Click on individual markers to get more information about each earthquake.
